// Mini Challenge #5 "Mad Lib"
// This is a program that asks a user to create a silly short story using input from the user

// peer review: Jessie Lamzon
// The code has no errors and runs smoothly.  I found no errors with the code as well. Only thing i would add is a .ToLower to the play again so user input for end can be any case. The story was really funny!  Good job
